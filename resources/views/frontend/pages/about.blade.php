     The Loan Management System plays a major role. Itâ€™s purpose to provide loan to the loan seeker with the information they need to make a comprehensive assessment of whether the loan can be deemed suitable for them, and thus meet the obligations of responsible lending. For this project in data collection phase I collected primary and secondary data. Longbitz Software Solutions provided with all type of primary and secondary data needed to develop the system. The procedures and processes that I followed to develop this system are clearly described in the analysis and design chapter
